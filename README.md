## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode 15+
- iOS 17+ Simulator or device

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VidiPT89/iVidiBlocks.git
cd iVidiBlocks
open iVidiBlocks.xcodeproj
```

Build and run (`⌘R`) on the simulator or a connected device.

> The Xcode project is generated with [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) from `project.yml`. If you add or move Swift files, regenerate it with `xcodegen generate`.

## 📖 Usage

1. Pick a mode: Marathon, Sprint or Ultra
2. Drag left and right to move, tap either side of the board to rotate
3. Swipe down for a hard drop, swipe up to hold the current piece
4. Clear four lines at once for a quad, or rotate a T piece into a tight gap for a T-spin
5. Chain hard clears back to back for a 1.5× score bonus

Language, appearance, DAS/ARR, ghost piece, control layout, music and haptics are all adjustable in Settings.

## 🎮 Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Drag horizontally | Move left / right |
| Drag down | Soft drop |
| Swipe down | Hard drop |
| Tap left / right side of the board | Rotate counter-clockwise / clockwise |
| Swipe up | Hold |

Prefer buttons? Turn on **On-screen buttons** in Settings and pick a left or right handed layout. Hold a horizontal arrow to repeat movement using DAS/ARR. Controls wrap to two rows on narrow screens and expose VoiceOver actions. You can also tap the hold panel; it dims until holding is available again. Clear banners show awarded points, Back-to-Back and combo bonuses together.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
xcodebuild -project iVidiBlocks.xcodeproj -scheme iVidiBlocks \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' test
```
